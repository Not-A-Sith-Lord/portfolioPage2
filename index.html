            <h2>What is Unschooled?</h2>
              <div class="callout overview">
                <p>Unschooled is both my interactive resume to creativly present my competence to potential employers, as well as a sandbox for crafting an onlnie education platform. My goal is to chronicle and quantify (as best I can) my acquisition of skills as I delve deeper into software development, but also to lay the ground work for a web application that would help others do the same and much more. Let's break down why I think there's an oppurtunity to do this.</p>

                <h4>Starting with Bootcamps</h4>

                <p>Bootcamps have quickly risen to prominence in recent years to fufill a desperate need for more software developers. Unlike traditional universities which take a theoretical approach to coding, Bootcamps are hands on with the latest and most in demand technologies and skills. But with an average of $10k tuition Bootcamps aren't an easily accessible avenue to learn these skills.</p>

                <p>With dozens of students in a class, such high margins means Bootcamps aren't likely to eat their own lunch with more scalable and accessible solutions. We can though. The chief pilot feature I will be exploring for UnSchooled will be "equivalency programs". This feature takes the abundant and diverse learning content of the web and gives it the structure and pace of any desired Bootcamp curriculum, free of charge. Regardless of which programs you opt for, or if you mix and match your own, milestones and skills will be aggregated on your student profile. Subsequent feature releases can tackle the networking and collaborative advantages of Bootcamps by allowing users to meet up with other nearby students, groups, and even tutors. </p>

                <h4>Why Stop There?</h4>
                <p>While Bootcamps have sucessfully fufilled a demand gone largly unmet by traditional institutions, they do so without making any significant improvement to thier educational model. Thanks to scarcity and name recognition students are forced to pay high upfront costs and are locked into a set curriculum. And for what? A degree or Bootcamp certificate is a simple document that verifies you have done or learned X. After doing X we want to prove it so that employers will then give us a look. Not because the document has any intrinsic value, but because whatever you're proving you've done or learned hopefully is.</p>

                <p>The empowering realization is that employers don't actually care <i>where</i> you learned X. They just need reputable proof this is the case to filter applicants. The price of degrees therfore reflects not the quality of education, but the fact that for decades they were the only means available to employers of easily doing this. This mirrors high level education itself which was once only centrally available through such institiutions. With the web that has changed. Already there is so much learning content on the web that you can find equivalent or superior resources and lectures than anything a single school can provide. The "proof" part of the equation is the only thing that is still catching up.</p>

                <p> This is the missing part of online education. With our equivalency programs and crowdsourced content, we already aim to make high quality educational content on the web easier to navigate than ever before. Next is simply proving what you can do to employers. We can help you do this through proctored exams, exercises, and vetted projects. Unlike a university however such services will be optional and distinct from your educational tract. By seperating the education and certificate, you won't be forced to spend outrageous sums and locked into convuluted course requirements to get employer attention. Pay as you go and for what you want as it helps you. Or just prove it all your way on your own. This is your education. You're in control. In the digital age, who needs gate keepers? </p>

                <p>Fortunatly for us employers already want better ways to recruit. When it comes to software and web development in particular, employers already value projects and shiped code over ambigious degrees. These tell them much more about the value someone is likely to be able to create for them than anything else can. Recruiting accounts and tools baked into UnSchooled could mean employers can activly search for not just programmers by the required technology skill level, other experince like creative problem solving or project managment, and so much more. Until then, by making the student profile as easy to share and as useful as possible employers will be able to immediatly know more about the applicant, their skills, and their drive than they ever could with a simple piece of paper.  </p>

           <h2>Skill Profile</h2>
            <div class="callout skillBox">
             <!--
              <p>The relevant skills of a web programmer can be broken up into 3 groups. The first is domain specific knowledge when it comes to different technologies. While some may have significant expertise with Java and PHP others may be in their element working with C# and Angular. Using my platform a user can rank up "skill badges" that represent a certain technology by submitting projects that reflect experince in it. You can see an early prototype of this at work below. This is by far the most easily quantifiable of the skill types. </p>
              <p>The second skill type is based on universal problem solving and computer logic. These skills are transferrable between technologies and stacks, and are the hallmark of more experinced and versatile programers. It is reflected in the time it takes for a programmer to learn a new technology and the quality of code written. Individuals who are high level in this respect often have both deep and wide knowledge of various technologies. We can attempt to measure this in the future via different proctored tests for problem solving in software. Excercises would present them with different open ended challeneges they must engineer a novel solution for. </p>
              <p>The third type of skill is work ethic and other intangibles, which are not exclusive to programming. In the future we can attempt to measure work ethic by tracking user activity on the platform. For instance someone with slow but consistent contributions to a project can be considered to have a better work ethic than someone with a glut of contributions that declines quickly as they lose interest. This feedback can be given back to students to encoruage them by highlighting what they're doing well, as well as identifying where they can use improvement. </p>
            
              <ol>
                 <h4>To Do:</h4>
                 <li>Make each skill group clickable to dedicated page.</li>
                 <li>Create dedicated "logic/problem solving" skill group?</li>
                 <li>Page will describe and break down skill group, lead to dedicated skill pages (see enrolled programs)</li>
                 <li>Page will display all work and projects done that have contributed to increasing that skill level</li>
               
               </ol>

Our equivalency feature breaks down the top programs into interactive guides that teach you the same topics using a variety of online resources. Unlike traditional programs you also have the freedom to explore competing resources that may fit your learning style better, so you're not pidgeonholed into content that isn't working for you. Rate and review existing content, and submit or even create your own to earn reputation! In the future meet up with local students working on the same program.</p>

That which I haven't, mostly Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I'm confident I can learn on my own with online substitutes or other programs. Below is the curriculum for Wyncode in Miami and my estimated completion level of its curriculum. As I continue to fill up holes in my knowledge I will update it.
